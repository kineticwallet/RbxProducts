**RBXProducts** is a high-performance CLI tool for Roblox developers to manage Gamepasses and Developer Products using a JSON-based "Source of Truth" workflow. Stop clicking through the dashboard; start syncing.

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **Atomic Syncing**: Only updates changed fields. If you only change a price, it won't re-upload your icon.
- 🖼️ **Smart Hashing**: Uses MD5 file hashing to skip redundant image uploads, saving you time and moderation headaches.
- 📜 **Dual-Mapped Lua**: Generates a professional `Products.lua` module allowing instant lookup by `Name` or `ID`.
- 🛡️ **Open Cloud Native**: Built on official Roblox API Keys—no sensitive cookies or browser sessions required.
- 📁 **Workspace Management**: Keeps your icons and configs organized in a dedicated `.products` folder.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
npm install -g rbxproducts
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Initialize your credentials
Run this in your project root to link your Roblox Universe:

``` Bash
rbxproducts setup
```

2. Scaffold your workspace
Automatically creates the a `.products` working folder, template JSON, and fallback assets:

```Bash
rbxproducts batch-setup
```

3. Configure your assets

Open (WORKING DIRECTORY).products/products.json and add your items.
This is the configuration for which products are in your game.

It will look like:

``` json
[
    {
        "name": "New gamepass Example", // gamepass name
        "type": "Gamepass",
        "price": 150, // gamepass price
        "image": "images/example.png", // icon link, leave as a blank string ("") to ignore updates/prevent overwriting existing icon
        "desc": "Edit this description, set ignore = false and add your image!", // your gamepass description
        "ignore": true // this is skipped during syncing. Use for template/outdated gamepasses
    },
    {
        "name": "Automated Demo Pass (10 Robux)",
        "type": "Gamepass",
        "price": 15,
        "image": "images/sword.png",
        "desc": "Proof of Concept Gamepass!",
        "ignore": false
    },
    {
        "name": "DevProduct #1",
        "type": "DevProduct",
        "price": 50,
        "image": "images/shutdown.png", // empty image, won't update.
        "desc": "Dev Product #1 Description!",
        "ignore": false // will update when "batch-update" is called.
    },
]
```

Leave image as "" to use the default template when creating new products / won't update for existing products.

Set ignore: true to skip an item during sync.

5. Push to Roblox
Sync your local JSON to the cloud/Roblox:

``` Bash
rbxproducts batch-update
```

Your gamepasses / dev products are now updated!

5. Generate Lua Module
Create your Luau source-of-truth:

``` Bash
rbxproducts output-lua
```

#### 📝 The Lua Module
Running `output-lua` generates a module that looks like this:

``` Lua

--[[ 
    AUTO-GENERATED BY RBXPRODUCTS CLI
    Generated on: 12/17/2025

local Products = {
    Gamepasses = {
        ["Poseidon's Spear"] = {
            Name = "Poseidon's Spear",
            Id = 1632057515,
            ImageId = "rbxassetid://76785761257396",
        },
    },
    DevProducts = {
        ["DevProduct #1"] = {
            Name = "DevProduct #1",
            Id = 3482009549,
            ImageId = "rbxassetid://125714459379496" 
        },
    },
    GamepassById = {},
    DevProductById = {},
}

-- Setup ID-based references for O(1) lookups
for _, item in pairs(Products.Gamepasses) do
    Products.GamepassById[item.Id] = item
end
for _, item in pairs(Products.DevProducts) do
    Products.DevProductById[item.Id] = item
end

return Products
