1. In order to use the cli like any package globally in your system:

```lua
-- on mac
sudo npm install -g
-- on windows?
-- assumption, not tested!
npm install -g
```

This makes sure you can use the keyword `gpass` to run commands quickly without having to go to the directory every time!

```lua
gpass list -- lists all the gamepasses in the specified Roblox universe!
```

2. However, still have to go the directory every time to set the .env information!
